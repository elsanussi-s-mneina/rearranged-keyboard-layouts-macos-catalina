Note about this folder:
Only put keyboard layouts whose only difference from an original keyboard layout is that their commands layer is in Dvorak instead of the usual QWERTY.

As of version v0.44 of Arabic PC (DVORAK command) layout, these are the new changes.

To switch text direction: 

(Note do not use the numberpad for the following commands, use the row of numbers above the home row.)

## To switch to right-to-left (embedded):
Opt + Shift + 2 

## To switch to left-to-right (embedded):
Opt + Shift + 1

## To undo the most recent switch (embedded):
Opt + Shift + 0

## To add a zero-width Arabic character:
Opt + Shift + 7

(an explanation: a zero-width Arabic character can be useful in cases where you only need to make the last bracket or full stop behave properly instead of showing up on the wrong side of the page. You can achieve the same thing using embeddings.)
