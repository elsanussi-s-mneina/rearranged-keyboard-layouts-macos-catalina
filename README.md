# Rearranged Mac OS Catalina Keyboard Layouts (Dvorak, Colemak)
These keyboard layouts were generated by using the keyboard layouts that are provided by on the Mac OS Catalina operating system as a starting point.

We got this by first using a program called Ukelele which allows one to save and edit system provided keyboard layouts. Then I open the XML files in a source code editor. I copy the relevant sections and run through a Python script that rearranges the keys. The Python script is available at https://github.com/elsanussi-s-mneina/keyboard-layout-translation
